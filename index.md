## Chiptune

I compose music for **retro sound hardware**, primarily the Ricoh 2A03 sound chip on the NES, under the alias **petet**.  My work has won awards on the chip compo site [Battle of the Bits](https://battleofthebits.org/barracks/Profile/petet/), and has been featured on [STAFFcirc vol. 5](https://sexytoadsandfrogsfriendcircle.bandcamp.com/album/5taffcirc-vol-5-2a03-puritans-5th-anniversary-edition).

## Electronic Music

Since 2011 I have also been producing electronic music under the alias **DXEyes**.  For earlier albums, my [Bandcamp](https://dxeyes.bandcamp.com/) page acts as an archive from middle through high school.

## Games

I have been developing computer games as a hobby for some time.  My most recent work, [BALMUNG](https://tic.computer/play?cart=636), was developed for the TIC-80 fantasy console, and won several small accolades. [Play it here!](https://tic.computer/play?cart=636)
